### Description
NutriMon’s most unique feature goal is to keep track of a user’s stock of ingredients and when they are expected to go bad:

"An estimated 30-40 percent of the United States’ food supply is wasted according to the USDA’s Economic Research Service.  This corresponds to approximately $161 billion worth of food in 2010.  This food waste is the largest component going into municipal landfills and quickly generates methane, which contributes to climate change.  Furthermore, all the land, water, labor, and energy that goes into producing, processing, transporting, preparing, storing, and discarding food are essentially wasted resources." - From USDA
